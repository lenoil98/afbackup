.TH INCR_BACKUP 8 "2001 April 1" "Debian Project"
.SH NAME
incr_backup \- run an incremental backup with the afbackup package.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B incr_backup <options ... See: full_backup> [ -EH ] [ -Q <backup-level> ]
.SH DESCIPTION
This program reads the client-side configuration
file and runs an incremental backup, i.e. all files and
directories are saved, whose modification time is later
than the moment the previous backup (full or incremental) has
started. The options and their meanings are exactly the same as
for full_backup, except the -a option, see below. The total
backup counter is not increased.
.PP
.TP
.B -a
Differential mode. The timestamp storing the time of the last
backup is not modified.
.TP
.B -E
Use not only the modification time comparing
the timestamps to select filesystem entries
for backup, but also the inode change
time (ctime)
.TP
.B -H
If this flag is set, all backups with a lower level
since the last full backup are removed from the indexes
and the respective tapes freed, if there is no other
backup data on them. In differential mode (-a) a
previous differential backup is also removed and the
tapes freed, if possible
.TP
.B -Q <backup-level>
The backup level. All files modified since the
most recent backup with a level equal or
higher are saved. The higher this number, the
more files are redundantly saved again.
<level> can be an arbitrary number from 0
up to 2147483646 (== MAXINT - 1). Default: 0.
A full backup has an implicit backup level of
2147483647 (== MAXINT)
