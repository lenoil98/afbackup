[ -d <devicename> ] [ -b <blocksize> ]
[ -s <set-file-cmd> ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The first form writes a label to the tape, the second form shows
the label on the tape, that is currently loaded.
The tape-label must be an integer number. This number is written
to the tape currently in the drive and identifies it uniquely. It
must be in the range from 1 to the number of cartridges given in
the configuration file. This label is written at the beginning
of the tape, so all data on tape will be lost. Due to that fact
the user is always prompted, if he really wants to do this.
.I <config-file>
can be a different configuration file than the one
the server process is started with. Normally it makes no sense
to use this option, but in extremely pathological cases the
program might not be able to find out the full path to the
configuration file. Then is has to be supplied at the command
line.
.br
The normal case is to use this command without options, but the
settings in the serverside configuration file can be overridden,
if necessary.
.br
If it is intended to label a tape, while a server is waiting for
another cartridge being put into the drive, the -F option must
be used to override the lock, that is held by the server process.
The server will be kept from probing, whether a tape is in the
drive, while the label_tape program is running. label_tape
should be started, before the tape to be labeled is put into the
drive. Otherwise the server might eject it at once after probing.
label_tape will prompt for confirmation before performing any
tape access (if started without -f option). Thus the tape should
be loaded after starting the command and before confirming.
.TP
.B -b <blocksize>
The blocksize of the device to use
.TP
.B -C <num-carts>
The total number of handled cartridges
.TP
.B -c <configfile>
A different configuration file to use
.TP
.B -d <devicename>
The device to use
.TP
.B -F
Continue regardless of a lock, probably set by other
running applications, especially the server. This
option may be used to label a tape, while the server
is waiting for a cartridge to be put into the
streamer device.
.TP
.B -f
Force operation without further asking
.TP
.B -n <comment>
A comment to include into the tape label
(256 characters max)
.TP
.B -r
Remove the cartridge in the drive from the
cartridge handling database without further
asking
.TP
.B -S <sec-label>
The secondary label number, the server will
accept, if the primary label number does
not match
.TP
.B -s <setf-cmd>
The command to reel the tape to a given
file position
