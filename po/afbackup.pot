msgid "The `Subentries' list allows to browse through the index of saved files and directories. Clicking with the left mouse key selects an entry, so it can be copied to the lower list pressing the `Select' key. When entries are selected, details can be listed for them pressing the `Show Details' button. The format string from the Options dialog will be used. Clicking the right mouse button over an item in the `Subentries' list climbs down (or up in case of the item ..) the tree. The character / (slash) at the end of a `Subentries' item indicates, that navigation below this item is possible. Several items in the subentries can be selected.\nAt top level there are two entries: The slash / and a dot . The slash represents the absolute entries in the backup file index, the dot all relative entries (the recommended way). Clicking on items in the list below is useful for deselection pressing the `Delete' button.\nNavigation to a known subentry (i.e. a full path) is possible editing the top entry under `Path' and pressing the Return key. The path, that will prefix the recovered files and directories, can be adjusted changing the relocation directory in the `Options' dialog. A browser can be opened for this purpose.\nPressing `Start Restore' will start the recovery of the items in the lower list. A window displaying the messages of the restore program will pop up.\nSelecting a directory will restore everything below.\nThe Exit button terminates the program.\nA status display on the bottom of the window indicates the progress of index scans etc. Please be patient, scanning the index can be very time consuming, if it is big, and due to the terrible implementation of this program.\nContext sensitive help is available, when F1 is pressed over an item of the dialog, that has the input focus (can be changed using the TAB key)."

msgid "The relocation directory is the place, where recovered files and directories should be put. The `Modified after date' specifies a time, that the stored files should have as the earliest modification time stamp. Versions stored earlier are not recovered or browsed. For the `Modified before date' the inverse criterion applies. The settings 'Backup after date' and 'Backup before date' refer to the backup starting time. If given, browsing and restore applies for filesystem entries written in backups, that started after / before the given time, respectively. All four dates can be given. For each of them: if the time is not fully specified, 00:00 is assumed. If the year is not given, the current year is used. Day and month must both be present, only one of them is not sufficient, or both may be omitted. In the latter case the year is ignored. If no date is given, the latest version of a file is restored. The `Clear Cache' button clears the index scanning cache. When Before- or After- dates are changed, the index cache is quite likely invalid. Pressing this button enforces a rescan. The `Details Format' string will be used when listing file details. For applicable patterns see the section FORMAT STRING in the manual pages of afrestore."
