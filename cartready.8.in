.TH CARTREADY 8 "2001 April 1" "Debian Project"
.SH NAME
cartready \- tell the tape server about cartridge changes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cartready
(No arguments evaluated)
.SH DESCRIPTION
If you have no cartridge handling system, a human must put the
next cartridge into the drive, if necessary. Then the backup-
server must get a hint, when the maintainer has done it. This
is achieved entering this command on the backup server host,
after the new cartridge is inserted. Nonetheless the server
process waits a certain timespan, until it accesses the drive
the next time (See: "Cart-Insert-Gracetime" in 
@serverlibdir@/@serverconf@).
.SH FILES

.IP @servervardir@
