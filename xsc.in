Whitespace characters may be used in this identifier, but they are replaced with asterisks * before comparing, so they are not significant." ]

It is mandatory to supply the no-rewind device here. Otherwise this package won't work properly. This may also be the path of a directory. Then the backup is written to files in this directory. Suitable device names for some OS-es:\nAIX:          /dev/rmt0.1\nSolaris:      /dev/rmt/0bn\nIRIX:         /dev/rmt/tps0d4nr\nHP-UX:        /dev/rmt/0hn\nLinux:        /dev/nst0\nDigital UNIX: /dev/nrmt0h\nFreeBSD:      /dev/nsa0\nIf the drive has a media handler attached, a specifier for this may follow the device name. The format for this is =<drive-count>@<device>#<num-slots>^<num-loadbays>, for example =1@/dev/sg0#6^2 . Whitespace before and following the special characters = @ and # is allowed for readability. The example means: The drive is number 1 in the changer, /dev/sg0 is the changer device, that has 6 media slots and 2 loadbays. The parts =<drive-count> and ^<num-loadbays> are optional.\nIf the server is only used for remote start and no real backup device should be accessed, a dash - should be configured here as device, so a respective warning to the server log will be suppressed." ]
set helps(3) [ TN_ "The blocksize of the tape device. This value specifies, how many bytes are written to tape or read from it in one system call. Usually this value is at least 512 or a multiple of it. It is not very important, whether the blocksize is set to 2048 or 1024. The main thing to keep in mind is that if there is a minimum, it should be respected (e.g. 1024 on AIX), otherwise media space is wasted." ]
set helps(4) [ TN_ "Three numbers and a filename can be given here. The first number is the desired size of the tape buffer in bytes. The optional second number is the high-watermark while writing in percent (default: 67), the optional third number is the low watermark, also in percent (default: 0). As long as the buffer fill rate does not reach the high watermark, nothing is written, but when it is reached, writing does not stop until the buffer fill rate is equal or below the low watermark. This procedure hopefully reduces tape wear and increases average writing speed, because excessive tape stops/starts are avoided. If the optional filename is given, buffering is done in the given file, which is mapped into the server's address space for that purpose. In the filename, patterns are replaced like with Changer-Configuration-File (18)." ]
set helps(5) [ TN_ "This value must be 1 or 0, what means, that you either have a cartridge handling system (i.e. some kind of robot) (1) or not (0). If you don't have a robot, you may nonetheless maintain a set of cartridges, that you have to number manually. The backup server side will inform you via email or console output, whenever another cartridge has to be inserted into the drive and what number it requires it is." ]

Each specifier may consist of digits, commas and dashes. Examples for cartridge set specifiers: 1-5 7-9,12 6,10,11 This example shows how to specify three cartridge sets. If this parameter is not given, there is only the default set number 1 containing all available cartridges. Not all cartridges need to be included in a set and sets must not overlap. See the man-page of afserver.conf how to configure client access restrictions for cartridge sets individually." ]

The range specifier must end in a colon : and may contain lists of ranges and numbers. A given number without a leading range specifier will be valid for all tapes not explicitly described. Default is use of full tape capacity. Several entries must be separated by whitespace and may look like the following examples: 4000000000 1,3-5:3500000000 7,9-:5000000000" ]

When the server wants to write with variable append mode enabled, any cartridge, that is in the drive, is belonging to the right cartridge set and is allowed to be written, will be accepted and appended to. Note, that this will also override the settings of cartis or option -G." ]

This is the default. If this parameter is set, the next cartridge is chosen from those, that are available in the slots of a changer, if present and configured. If there is no tape found inside the changer, that is allowed to be overwritten, manual administrator interaction is nonetheless required." ]

Normal devices need a certain time span to mount the tape to get it ready for use. Normally this value is not critical. If you estimate it too low, the ioctl-system-call will wait until the device becomes available. This time is sometimes longer than two minutes, so if you want to proceed quickly after a cartridge change, you may measure the maximum time, your system needs.

In the latter case this package tries to maintain the number of the current cartridge in a file and to (hopefully) keep it consistent with the reality. In this case the cartridge handling system must be configured to sequential mode (automatically putting the next cartridge in, when the current one is ejected). The pattern %c, if used in this command, will be replaced with number of the current cartridge, %n with the number of the next one, that is expected to be put into the streamer by a robot in sequential mode after eject. %b can be used instead of %c if counting of cartridges starts with 0 and not with 1.

The client selector is either a list of comma-separated hostnames, a filename starting with a slash / containing hostnames one per line, or a command starting with a bar, that is stripped off before starting the command. The command gets the current client name as input on stdin, aside from arguments containing patterns (see below). If the command returns an exit status of 0, the client name will match the entry. Entries are separated by whitespace. If an entry must contain whitespace, it must be enclosed by double quotes. If colons are needed within the filenames, they must be escaped using a backslash. Each key file must contain at least 5 characters and must not have read permission for group or world.
