.SH DESCRIPTION
The first form can be used for restoring selected pieces of
a certain previous backup run. If no option of the type
.I -<past-backup-no>
is supplied (e.g. -2 ), the most recently
made backup is accessed. If an option like this is given,
the backup system tries to extract the files from the backup
before ( -1 ) or even an earlier one. This requires, that
enough file- and directory-name-logging is provided. This
can be done with the client-side configuration parameter
NumIndexesToStore (See: afclient.conf(8)). The parameters
.I <path-pattern>
indicate, which files and directories should be restored. An
asterisk is implicitely put before and after the
.I <path-pattern>,
so it is assumed to be a substring of the path. This can be
prevented preceding the
.I <path-pattern>
with the option -p.
These may be wildcards for the full path name leading to the
file relative to the directory, to that the client changes
before starting any backup or restore (See under the parameter
RootDirectory under afclient.conf(8)).
Note, that you have to put these into 
quotes, if you are using wildcards to prevent substutition. It
is a bad idea to restore a total backup entering: restore "*"
This leads to a huge filelist to be processed by the client,
what might plug up memory and/or temporary space in some
filesystem. Instead you should use the second form with the
option -a, what restores a total backup. The third form
restores without looking for filename log files. Instead it
reads the standard input for information, where to extract
from. The format expected at standard input is the same as
produced by incr_backup or full_backup, if the configuration
option StartupInfoProgram is used. The given program is then
supplied with the appropriate information and should write
it to some place outside the local host, so that it will not
be affected by a hard crash (see: StartupInfoProgram in
afclient.conf(8)). The flag -e can be supplied more than one time. In
that case the emergency restore goes back to the beginning of
the previous full backup, if the full backup is split into
several parts (configuration parameter NumBackupParts) and
the last part of the current full backup has not yes run. If
the backup parts configuration has changed after the beginning
of the previous full backup, this option should be considered,
as it gives additional safety, that really everything will be
restored. The fourth form scans the cartridges (if supplied)
on the given servers (if supplied, eventually with alternate
given port numbers - see below for the format, how to specify
cartridge/host/port-triples) for backups done from the host,
where the restore program is started and restores everything
it finds. The functionality is similar to -e, but no input has
to be supplied. Like with option -e, the -E flag can be given
several times, what has the same meaning like with option -e
(see above). If the client's hostname has changed or restore
should be done on another host, the original client ID must be
supplied with the -W option. Otherwise nothing or the wrong
stuff will be restored. Scanning the cartridges can take a lot
of time, but it should be several minutes, not hours.
Cartridges can be supplied in three forms as arguments: simple
numbers, ranges (e. g. as 3-5 without spaces), and ranges
relative to the current backup writing position (e. g. as -3).
In the latter case -0 means the cartridge, that will be written
to next time i.e. that holds the current writing point. -2 stands
for the latest 3 cartridges. To indicate, that a cartridge is
located at a certain backup server, maybe with a special port
number (if there are several backup servers), the cartridge
number or range can be followed by the at-character @, optionally
followed by the percent character % and the port number, e. g.
3-5@buhost%2989 . No whitespace is allowed in such a specifier.
If no port is given, the default port is assumed (2988). If no
hostname is given, the default backup server is used. Default
backup server is the first one in the list, that is configured
in the parameter file or overriden by the option -h. Any number
of ranges or numbers can be supplied, overlapping duplicates are
ignored. If no cartridge numbers are given, the program searches
backward from the current writing position on each configured
backup server until it thinks, it has enough backups found, or
all cartridges on that server have been tried. The found backups
are sorted in the correct order (using the stored backup time)
and afterwards everything found is restored.
This form of the command needs
no information at all for an emergency restore.
If the configuration file is not supplied
explicitly,
then it is searched for in the @clientlibdir@ and if not
found there the files /etc/buclient.conf, /etc/afbuclient.conf,
/etc/afclient.conf and
/etc/afbackup/client.conf are tried.
.PP
.TP
.B -A <date> 
restore files modified after the given date. A second
date may be given prefixed with a percent sign %
telling to search only backups started after the
given date. Either of the dates can be omitted, so
valid specifications are "<date>" "%<backupdate>"
or "<date> % <backupdate>" . Like shown, the argument
should be put into quotes, cause it usually contains
whitespace. Valid formats are e.g.:
.br
  MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss
.br
  DD.MM.YYYY hh:mm:ss
.br         
or the formats produced by ctime(3) or date(1). The
year may be supplied in two digits or in the non-US-
formats be omitted, then the current year is assumed.
The seconds may also be omitted (hh:mm), the whole
time may be left off, then 00:00 is assumed. Thus
the shortest valid format is DD.MM
.TP
.B -B <date>
restore files modified before the given date. A second
date may be given prefixed with a percent sign %
telling to search only backups started before the
given date. See
.B -A 
for the valid date formats
.TP
.B -C <rootdir>
change to the given root-directory before restoring
files instead of the one specified in the client
side configuration file. If this directory does
not exist, it will be created
.TP
.B -c <configfile>
use the given file for configuration information
.TP
.B -e   
restore all files from the previous backup in an
emergency case without looking for the filename
logfiles, which are also restored
.TP
.B -F <format-string>
In combination with -l a format string for output.
Default is: only the full paths of the stored
files are printed, one per line. The format string
can also contain patterns representing other file
attributes present in the index file(s). For possible
patterns see below under FORMAT STRING.
.TP
.B -f   
restore only the filename logfiles in an emergency
case
.TP
.B -h <hostnames>
Use the given list of hosts as backup servers. This
list is used only, if no hostname information can
be found as associated with the current filesystem
entry, that should be restored. The first host in
this list is the default server, if no hostname
information at all can be found. If -E is given
and no cartridge number is supplied at all, all
hosts in this list are tried one after the other.
The hostnames in this list can be separated by
whitespace and/or commas
.TP
.B -I <idx-prefix>
The first part of the filename, the names of the
stored files and directories are written to. The
current total backup number is appended (that
increments each start of a full backup). If these
files undergo processing, .z is appended
.TP
.B -i
Ignore case distinctions in the filename patterns
.TP
.B -k <file>
Use the contents of the given file as encryption
key for authenticating to the server
.TP
.B -l   
Do not restore anything, just list the names of
the files and/or directories, that fit the supplied
path-part(s); in combination with -E: just scan the
given tape(s) and printout the minimum restore info,
that can be read by restore -e
.TP
.B -M <server-message-config>
The configuration to output messages from the server,
that normally are sent only via mail to a maintainer.
The first word consisting of the letters b r v and c
tells, whether to output messages during backup,
restore, verify and copy-tape, respecively. The next
words must name the service name or port number of
the single stream servers, related to the option -P .
For each multi stream service configured with -P or
in the configuration file, the respective single
stream service must be given here
.TP
.B -m
Do not overwrite existing files (merge)
.TP
.B -n   
do not restore anything, just printout a message,
how many files and/or directories fit the supplied
path-part(s); in combination with -E: just scan the
given tape(s) and printout, what backups have been
written there
.TP
.B -N <numidxs>
The maximum number of index files, that are scanned
for matching filenames. With each full backup, a new
index file is created. If time restrictions are given
(options -A or -B), all existing index files are
read, what may take a long time, if many of them are
kept available (see clientside configuration option
NumIndexesToStore or option -N of full_backup). So
using this parameter the scanning can be restricted
to a certain number of files
.TP
.B -O <maxidxage>
The maximum age of index files, that are scanned for
matching filenames, in days. See option -N . The
given number of days may be a floating point value
.TP
.B -P <portnos>
The list of port numbers for the backup servers
either configured in the parameter file or supplied
with the -h option. This list is used only, if no
port number information can be found as associated
with the current filesystem entry, that should be
restored. The port numbers supplied here are associated
with the backup server names by position.
The port numbers in this list can be separated by
whitespace and/or commas
.TP
.B -T <tapes>
Restore and list only files from the given list of
tapes. Tapes can be specified using numbers, commas
and dashes, e.g. 3-5,8,1
.TP
.B -t
Do not restore anything, just list the tapes, that
would be needed to restore everything that matches
the supplied path-part(s)
.TP
.B -V <var-dir>
The directory, where varying files are put
.TP
.B -z <proccmd> <unproccmd>
The commands to use for process and unprocess. If
a command comprises of several words, it must be
put in quotes
.PP
I suggest to run restore with the 
.B -l 
option before really going
to restore anything. So you see, what files will be generated,
without overwriting existing ones unintendedly.
.SH FORMAT STRING
The following patterns will be replaced:
.TP
.B %n
The filename with full path like in default output
.TP
.B %b
The basename of the file, without path
.TP
.B %O
The username of the file owner
.TP
.B %o
The user-ID of the file owner (integer)
.TP
.B %m
The modification time in seconds since epoch
.TP
.B %M
The modification time in readable format
.TP
.B %t
The starting time of the backup containing
the file in seconds since epoch
.TP
.B %T
Like %t, but in readable format
.TP
.B %h
The hostname of the backup server, to that
the file has been backuped
.TP
.B %p
The port number of the backup server, to that
the file has been backuped
.TP
.B %c
The cartridge number on the server, the saved
file can be found on
.TP
.B %f
The tape file number on cartridge %c, where
the saved file can be found
.TP
.B %%
A percent character
.PP
The usual C-like backslash sequences are allowed,
but special characters within the filenames are
still printed as escape sequences, e.g. \\n .
A newline at the end must be given explicitly as
backslash n (\\n), otherwise no new line will start.
Double quotes should be written as \" within the
argument enclosed in single quotes. To see several
versions of a saved filesystem entry in the indexes
the option -B or -A must be given, maybe with a
condition, that is always true, e.g. -B 23:59, what
means: before today, 23:59.
.SH FILES
.IP @clientconfdir@/@clientconf@
Client configuration file
.IP @clientlogdir@
The directory for logging the client backups
.IP @clientvardir@
Some internal state information of the client backups.
