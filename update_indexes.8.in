.TH UPDATE_INDEXES 8 "2001 April 1" "Debian Project"
.SH NAME
update_indexes \- clean indexes from erased tapes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B update_indexes
[ -v ]  [ -c <configuration-file> ]
[ -h <backuphosts> ] [ -P <backup-ports> ]
[ -I <indexfile-part> ] [ -V <var-directory> ]
[ -k <encryption-key-file> ] [ -W <identity> ]
[ -z <process-cmd> <unprocess-cmd> ]
[ -Z <built-in-compress-level> ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command asks all the servers, which tapes are considered
precious for the client, it is run on. If the server will tell
fewer tapes than the client has in mind, then the tapes, that
the server omitted, have been erased on the server side. Now
those entries will be removed from the client's indexes, who
list the erased tapes as backup location.
This command may be installed setuid root, so normal users can
start it. As it performs just a defined update operation and
nothing else, there should not be a security problem. It might
be a good idea to run this command before some user restore
program (e.g. xafrestore) is started, so only those entries
are listed to the user, that really exist on backup media and
can be restored. When started by a normal user, all arguments
will be ignored and only the configuration file is evaluated.
.PP
.TP
.B -c <configfile>
Use the given file for configuration information
.TP
.B -h <hostname>
Use the given list of hosts as backup servers. 
The hostnames in this list can be separated by
whitespace and/or commas
.TP
.B -I <idx-prefix>
The first part of the filename, the names of the
stored files and directories can be found. The
current total backup number is appended (that
increments each start of a full backup). If these
files undergo processing, .z is appended
.TP
.B -k <file>
Use the contents of the given file as encryption
key for authenticating to the server, where the
source or target cartridge is handled,
respectively
.TP
.B -P <portnum>
The list of port numbers for the backup servers
either configured in the parameter file or supplied
with the -h option. The port numbers in this list
can be separated by whitespace and/or commas
.TP
.B -V <var-dir>
The directory, where varying files are put
.TP
.B -v
Verbose option, tell more about what is going on
.TP
.B -W <id>
Identify as <id> to the server. This is needed
by the server to tell the client the correct
information about tapes, that are considered
crucial for this client for restore
.TP
.B -z <z> <uz>
The commands to use for process and unprocess. If
a command comprises of several words, it must be
put in quotes
.TP
.B -Z <level>
If built-in compression should be used, the level
can be supplied here. If commands to process and
unprocess are also supplied with option -z, then
data is first processed by the process command,
then by built-in compression. During uncompress
it works the other way round
.SH FILES
.IP @clientconfdir@/@clientconf@
Client configuration file
.IP @clientlogdir@
The directory for logging the client backups
.IP @clientvardir@
Some internal state information of the client backups.
