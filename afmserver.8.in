.TH AFSERVER 8 "2001 April 1" "Debian Project"
.SH NAME
afmserver \- the multi-stream server of the afbackup package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B afmserver
[ <options> ] [ <configuration-file> ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The multi-stream server able to serve several clients in parallel.
This program works as a protocol multiplexing frontend for the
normal server, that in turn is started as backend in slave mode.
For the client side this server looks exactly like the normal
single stream server, so for them there is nothing special contac-
ting the multi stream server.
The clients must pass a unique identifier to the multi stream
server. Otherwise it cannot distinguish the clients, especially
when dispatching the data on tape to the clients. By default this
identifier is the official hostname of the client, that is
determined from the connection. A client may pass a different
identifier after having connected and authenticated successfully.
The options are identical to those of the server program except
for option -S, that is not applicable here, cause the multi-stream
server doesn't know a slave mode. The other options are also passed
to the server backend (see: afserver(8)), except for the following,
that are understood
only by mserver:
.PP
.TP
.B -d
Daemonize. Go into the background and run forever.
This is the way, the multi stream server can be
started without using the inetd. -p should be
supplied when using this option
.TP
.B -p <port>
The TCP port number or service name, the server
should bind to. If started via inetd, the inetd
binds to the port and starts the mserver connected
to the port. When started as daemon, the mserver
must be told the port to bind to. If not given,
the service entry afmbackup is used or, if not
found, the default port 2989
